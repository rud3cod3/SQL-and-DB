### NoSQL
- Designed to handle large Volume of Databases both structured and unstructured
- High user loads
- Need for flexibility and flexibility

### Types of NoSQLDB

#### Stored in documents ( usually json, bson and xml )
 - Each document is self-contained and can have a unique structure
 - Ideal for hierarchical data storage

#### Key-value stores
 - Store data as a collection of key-pairs
 - The key is uniq, and the value can be anything
 - Simple and fast, like a dictionary

 - USe nodes, edges and properties

### * Advantages

#### Schema flexibility
- **No fixed schema** you can store different types of data in the same database
- You dont need to define the structure before inserting data
- Ideal for **Agile development** where equiements charge frequently

#### Scalability (Horizontal Scaling)
- Easily scaled across **Multiple servers**
- Can handle **Huge volumes of data and high traffic** by adding more nodes

#### High Performance
- Optimized for **fast reads and write** especially under heavy loads
- Suitable for real-time applications like gaming, messaging apps and e-commerce

#### Big Data and Cloud Friendly
- Designed to work with **large datasets**, often used in **cloud-native** and **big-data** enviorments
- Often come with built-in supports for **application and partitioning**

#### Support for Various DataTypes
- Can Handle **structured, semi-structured and unstructured** data
- Usefull for modern application dealing with logs, user-generated content, IoT,etc.
